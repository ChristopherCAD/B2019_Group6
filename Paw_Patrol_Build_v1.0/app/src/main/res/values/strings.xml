    // Cat Diseases Descriptions

    <string name="cat_cancer"> Cancer in cats is the leading cause of death among cats. It is caused by uncontrolled cell
     growth, and affects a wide range of cell types and organs in the body. Feline cancer initially manifests as a lump
    or bump on any parts of the body.</string>

    <string name="biopsy">
        A Biopsy is a surgical procedure in which a piece of tumor is removed for study and analysis by a pathologist.
        The pathologist`s report will provide important information such as the type of cancer and its characteristics.
    </string>

    <string name="laboratory">
        Combinations of survey, radiography, abdominal ultrasonography, serial clinical pathology tests, including urinalysis
        and urine cultures, and blood pressures should be performed to evaluate the severity of the disease.
    </string>

    <string name="cancerPrevention">
        One common type of cancer in cats is Skin Cancer. Limiting your cat`s exposure to blazing heat can prevent it
        from catching skin cancer.
    </string>

    <string name="cancerPrevention2">
        Breast cancer is also a common cancer for cats, but having your cat spayed can prevent it from getting this
        type of cancer.
    </string>

    <string name="kidneyDisease">
        Kidney disease is a disease that if left untreated, can cause death in cats. Kidney disease is where your cat`s
        kidney are not properly working. This means that their kidney cannot filter blood as it is supposed to, a number
        of problem will arise if this disease is ignored.
    </string>

    <string name="kidneyMed1">
        There are a number of kidney disease medications to give to your cat, but having a veterinarian check up on your
        cat first is the first thing to do if you think your cat is sick.
    </string>

    <string name="kidneyMed2">
        If you suspect that your cat have Kidney Disease, take it to your vet and run a number of test such as Urine Tests,
        Ultrasound, and biopsy (if your vet says it is necessary).
    </string>

    <string name="kidneyPrevention">
        A kidney diet is low in both phosphorus and protein, and is enriched with vitamin D and Omega-3 fatty acids.
        Remember that it is important ti introduce your cat to new foods gradually. Your vet can advise how to make this
        transition an easy one.
    </string>

    <string name="kidneyPrevention2">
        Giving your cat access to clean water can save it the trouble from getting kidney disease. And with water, your
        cat can urinate regularly, but not excessively.
    </string>

    <string name="FIV">
        Feline Immunodefficiency Virus is one of the most common and consequential diseases of cats around the world.
        In infected cats, FIV attacks the immune system, leaving the cat vulnerable to many other infections.
        <br>
            <br>
            Although Cats infected with FIC may appear normal for years, they eventually suffer from immune defficiency,
            which allows normally harmless bacteria, viruses, and fungi found in everyday environment to potentially cause
            severe illnesses.
            </br>
        </br>
    </string>

    <string name="FIVtreatment">
        Vaccination will always be a priority; before your cats even get FIV, it should be vaccinated. Although the vaccine
        will not protect all cats, your cat is better safe than sorry. Don`t take chances.
    </string>

    <string name="FIVtreatment2">
        The most effective treatment for this illness is a regular visit to your vet. Having you vet check up on your cat`s
        condition will help your cat recover, even bit-by-bit.
    </string>

    <string name="FIVtreatment3">
        Treating secondary infections with the help of your vet will prevent your cat`s condition to worsen. Secondary
        infections such as wounds and intestinal parasites should be controlled as to help your cat.
    </string>

    <string name="FIVtreatment4">
        A balanced diet will further improve your cat`s condition and health, it will invigorate your cat and make it happy.
    </string>

    <string name="FIVtreatment5">
        Because of FIV, your cat`s immune system will weaken; making your cat vulnerable to bacteria and diseases.
        Tumors might develop in your cat`s body. This can be prevented by doing regular check ups to the vet.
    </string>

    <string name="FIVPrevention">
        The primary mode of transmission for FIV is through bite wounds from infected cats. Sexual contact also carries
        a risk from infecting or getting infected from FIV. That`s why keeping your cat indoors or away from cats that
        you might think is infected is a good course of action.
    </string>

    <string name="FIVPrevention2">
        Cats tend to be aggressive when they are in heat. As such, they are prone to biting and scratching other cats.
        Either spay your cats to prevent this kind of aggression, or separate your cat in heat to prevent fighting among them.
    </string>

    <string name="FELV">
        Feline Leukemia Virus is one of the most common infectious diseases in cats, affecting between 2-3% of cats in the
        United States alone. Infection rates are significantly higher (up to 30%) in cats that are ill or otherwise at high risk.
    </string>

    <string name="felvTreatment">
        As always, you should always consult your cat`s condition to your vet. As they will tell you the necessary treatment
        for a cat suffering from FELV.
    </string>

    <string name="felvPrevent">
        The only sure way to protect cats from FeLV is to prevent their exposure to FeLV-infected cats. Keeping cats indoors,
        away from potentially infected cats is recommended. If outdoor access is allowed, provide supervision or place cats
        in a secure enclosure to prevent wandering and fighting.
    </string>

    <string name="Pancreatitis">
        Pancreatitis occasionally occurs in the cat. When it does, it is often accompanied by inflammation of the liver
        and intestine. This multi-organ inflammatory process is sometimes referred to as “triaditis”. This occurs because
        the inflammation associated with acute pancreatitis allows digestive enzymes to spill into the abdominal cavity.
    </string>

    <string name="pancreatitisTreatment">
        cats are good at hiding pain, so we need to always assume that pain is present and treat it appropriately
        (pain causes disease and prevents healing).
    </string>

    <string name="IVFluids">
        Intravenous fluids will be given to maintain normal fluid and electrolyte balance, and analgesics will be given
        to control the intense pain. Many cases will also require anti-inflammatory drugs, or other medication to control
        vomiting or diarrhea.
    </string>

    <string name="NSAIDs">
        non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) to reduce inflammation and reduce pain (these are avoided if your
        cat is dehydrated or has kidney issues).
    </string>

    <string name="VitB">
        If the pancreas is unhealthy it doesn`t make a thing called "intrinsic factor" that is needed for vitamin 
        B12 absorption from the diet (deficiency can cause anaemia).
    </string>

    <string name="panPrevent">
        Avoid feeding your cat high-fat meals or table scraps and keep them at a healthy weight.
    </string>

    <string name="panPrevent2">
        Bring your cat in for regular wellness visits to check if your cat is developing health-related stuff that you
        don`t want to worsen.
    </string>

    <string name="hyperthyroidism">
        Hyperthyroidism results when the thyroid gland over-produces thyroid hormones. It’s the most common endocrine
        disease of cats older than 8-years-old. (An endocrine disease is a disease of the organs that make and secrete
        hormones.)
    </string>

    <string name="hypeTreatment1">
        When available, radioactive iodine therapy is the treatment of choice for cats with hyperthyroidism. During treatment,
        radioactive iodine is administered as an injection and is quickly absorbed into the bloodstream. The iodine, which
        is required for the production of both T3 and T4, is taken up by the thyroid gland and the emitted radiation destroys
        the abnormal thyroid tissue without damaging the surrounding tissues or the parathyroid glands.
    </string>

    <string name="hypeTreatment2">
        Removal of the thyroid glands, called surgical thyroidectomy, is a relatively straightforward surgical procedure
        that has a good success rate. The advantage of surgery is that it is likely to produce a long-term or permanent cure
        in most cats, and therefore eliminates the need for long-term medication.
    </string>

    <string name="hypeTreatment3">
        Anti-thyroid drugs act by reducing the production and release of thyroid hormone from the thyroid gland. These
        medications do not provide a cure for the disease, but they do allow either short-term or long-term control
        of hyperthyroidism.
    </string>

    <string name="hypePrevent">
        There are currently no known preventive measures for hyperthyroidism, but early diagnosis decreases the secondary
        problems and improves the prognosis.
    </string>

    // Dog Diseases

    <string name="canine_distemper_string">
        Canine Distemper is a disease which is usually caused by a very contagious virus. Puppies and dogs usually become
        infected through virus particles in the air or in the respiratory secretions of infected dogs.
    </string>

        well as by contaminated stool, surfaces, food bowls, collars, leashes, equipment, and the hands and clothing of people.
        Treating parvo can be very expensive and many dogs die from parvo despite intensive treatment.
    </string>

    <string name="parvoFirstAid">
        A dog infected with parvo will have diarrhea and will often take a poop or vomit from time-to-time. Keeping your dog

    <string name="heatstroke">
        Heatstroke is a big risk during hot and warm weather. Remember that your dog is always wearing a fur coat and they
        are usually warmer than you are. A temperature that seems only a little warm to a person can be too hot for a dog.
        Add to that the fact that dogs are almost always playing and running around.
    </string>

    <string name="heatFirstAid">
        If you noticed your dog getting weaker or slower, and is having an excessive panting, give your dog a water to hydrate
        and prevent them from further heating up.

    <string name="Chytridiomycosis">
        Chytridiomycosis is a disease causing precipitous declines in frog and salamander populations on a global scale.
        There are two fungi responsible for this disease: Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) and Batrachochytrium salamandivorans (Bsal).
    </string>

    <string name="chyMed1">
        Antifungal medications are used to treat fungal infections. How it works is that the medication kills the fungal
        cells that are slowly spreading around your frog`s skin.
    </string>

    <string name="chyMed2">
        Giving your frog a salt bath (50 to 100 grams of sea salt per gallon) fir fifteen to thirty minutes everyday
        will help prevent the spreading of the fungal infection in its skin.
    </string>

    <string name="chyMed3">
        Chytridiomycosis is vulnerable to heat and will often die at temperatures above 32 degree celsius. Increasing
        the temperature of your frog`s housing will help kill this fungal infection and stop its spread.
    </string>

    <string name="fungalFrogPrevent">
        Control of chytridiomycosis in amphibian colonies includes disinfection of enclosures and implementation of
        husbandry practices that prevent cross-contamination of enclosures with water or substrate material.
        <br>
            <br>
                The infectious zoospores are sensitive to desiccation, and to date, no resting stages resistant

    <string name="redLegSyndrome">
        Red-leg syndrome is a widespread infection seen in frogs, toads, and salamanders. It is recognized by the redness
        on the underside of the amphibian`s legs and abdomen, and is generally due to Aeromonas hydrophila, an opportunistic
        bacterial pathogen.
        <br>
            <br>
             However, viruses and fungi may also cause similar reddening. Underfed, newly acquired amphibians that are kept in
                poor-quality water or other less-than-ideal environmental conditions are particularly susceptible
                to red-leg syndrome.

    <string name="Obesity">
        Generally referred to as obesity, excess body weight is as much a problem in amphibians as it is in humans.

    <string name="obesityFirstAid">
        Limiting your frog`s feeding session is the only way to control its diet. Don`t overfeed a frog as it will cause

    <string name="obesityMed1">
        Enlarge the amphibian’s living area or enclosure. Increasing the animal’s activity will improve its metabolic rate,

    <string name="obesityMed2">
        Maintaining the amphibian at the upper end of its preferred temper¬ature range will also accelerate metabolic
        rate and increase caloric use.

                However, care should be taken to never exceed the maximum recom¬mended temperature for the amphibian species.
                Lastly, reducing the amount of food given to an animal will help with many nutritional disorders, including
                obesity.

    <string name="obesityPrevent">
        Although overfeeding can easily lead to an obese amphibian, monitoring the animal’s food consumption and allowing it

        Loose, watery and possibly more-frequent bowel movements — is a common problem. It may be present alone or be
        associated with other symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain or weight loss.  Luckily, diarrhea is
        usually short-lived, lasting no more than a few days.

    </string>

    <string name="respMed">
        In general, treatment for guinea pigs will consist of alleviating the symptoms rather than for the pneumonia

        <br>
        <br>
            Supportive therapy with fluids may be necessary in cases of dehydration due to appetite loss, oxygen

    <string name="diarrheaGuinea">
        Guinea pigs have a sensitive gastrointestinal tract (as do rabbits). They have a very specific natural
        population of "good" gastrointestinal bacteria (flora) critical to normal bowel function.
        <br>
            <br>
                 If this normal bacterial flora becomes altered or unbalanced, `bad` (often gas-producing) bacteria
                can overgrow, produce painful gas, slow down digestion and food passage through the intestinal
                tract, damage the intestinal tissues, release toxins, cause severe diarrhea, and in severe cases,
                death.
            </br>
        </br>
    </string>

    <string name="diarrheaFirstAid">
        Whenever your pet has a diarrhea, the first thing you should do is always take it to the vet to check for
        underlying illness. But for the meantime, give your guinea pig a source of hydration. Water bowls,
        water bottles, etc. Diarrhea can be very dehydrating for animals.
    </string>

    <string name="diarrheaMed">
        If your pet refuses to drink water, take it to the vet for IV Fluid treatment. Antibiotics may be necessary
        if the diarrhea is caused by bacterial infection.
    </string>

    <string name="diarrheaPrevent">
        Ensuring that adequate roughage is included in your pet’s diet can prevent diet-related diarrhea.
        Diarrhea due to an infection, on the other hand, may be prevented by keeping the guinea pig`s bedding,
        water bottle, and living environment clean and sanitized; promptly removing uneaten food before it rots
        can also reduce the level of disease-causing organisms.
    </string>

    <string name="Scurvy">
        Guinea pigs and primates cannot manufacture their own vitamin C; therefore, they must take in vitamin C in
        their diets. The majority of other animals can produce their own vitamin C through their intestinal bacterial
        and maintenance of skin, joints, and mucosal surfaces, such as the gums. It is also important in the healing of wounds.
    </string>
    
    <string name="scurvyMed1">
        Scurvy is a Vitamin C defficiency. As such, the prescribed medications and treatment will involve your
        Guinea Pig taking in Vitamin C medications and food.

    <string name="scurvyMed2">
        Pain relief medication will often be given to make your guinea pig more comfortable. Some cases of
        Scurvy are very serious and can result in other damage to the body which needs additional treatment
        and procedures, and in some cases if not treated soon enough Scurvy can be fatal.
    </string>

    <string name="scurvyPrevent">
        The best way to prevent Scurvy is to ensure you feed your guinea pigs a balanced diet high in vitamin C.
        Commercial guinea pig pellets contain vitamin C but should only be fed in small amounts. So the rest of
        your guinea pigs vitamin C needs to come from fresh fruit and vegetables.

    <string name="Abscess">
        Infected swelling containing an accumulation of pus and bacteria can affect lymph nodes, skin, muscles,
        teeth, bones, and internal organs. Since guinea pigs and other rodents and rabbits form thick pus that
        does not drain or get reabsorbed easily, most abscesses in these animals require surgical removal
        debridement, followed by treatment with antibiotics chosen based on culture of the bacteria growing in
        the abscess.
    </string>

    <string name="abscessFirstAid">
        The affected area is flushed with sterile saline and/or antimicrobial solutions, which are solutions that
        kill or suppress the growth of the microorganisms.

    <string name="UTI">
        Guinea pigs are very prone to development of urinary calculi stones or uroliths. These stones most often
        form in the bladder but may also form in the kidneys or ureters tubes that drain the kidneys into the
        bladder. Stones may become lodged in the ureter or the urethra the tube carrying urine from the
        bladder to the outside, causing a life-threatening obstruction.

        infusions can be used such as cucumber or watermelon.
    </string>

    <string name="UTImed">
        Veterinarians will prescribe antibiotics such as enrofloxacin, meloxicam for a couple of days or weeks,

    <string name="UTIprevent">
        There are many things you can do to help prevent a guinea pig, especially a female which are more

    <string name="bumblefoot">
        Pododermatitis is a condition in which a guinea pig’s footpad becomes inflamed, develops sores, or becomes
        overgrown. The appearance may be similar to callouses, or small tumors on the bottom of the foot. This
        condition is commonly referred to as bumblefoot.
        <br>
            <br>
                When bumblefoot is left untreated or is present in a very severe form, there are sometimes

        </br>
    </string>
    
    <string name="bumblefootFirstAid">
        An effective way to treat bumblefoot is to soak the affected area in a solution of warm water and Epsom
        salts. You need to supervise your cavy at all times during this process, as the salt can get in its eye. Do
        this two to three times a day.
    </string>

    <string name="bumblefootMed">
        If the condition needs medical treatment beyond simple environmental changes, your veterinarian will
        provide this. Your veterinarian will clean the wounds, clip the hair around the infected areas, and trim any
        overgrown nails and dead tissue on the feet. Soaking the feet in antibiotic solutions may also prove to be
        useful.

        <br>
            <br>
                In severe cases, guinea pigs may need oral antibiotics and pain medications. You may also need to keep
                the feet bandaged, with fresh dressings and topical antibiotics applied regularly to encourage healing.
                Prolonged, untreated cases where pododermatitis has worsened to severe infection that
                is not responding to immediate treatment may require amputation of the infected leg.
            </br>
        </br>
    </string>

    <string name="bumblefootPrevent">
        Providing cages with smooth bottoms for your guinea pigs, keeping the floors clean and dry, and treating any
        injuries immediately can help prevent pododermatitis from occurring. Because this is a relatively common
        ailment, guinea pig owners are advised to check their pets` feet daily, including the length of the nails, and
        watching the guinea pig`s weight and making dietary changes as needed.
