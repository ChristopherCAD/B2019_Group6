    // Rabbit Diseases Description Strings

    <string name="D1Desc"> A rabbit`s teeth will continually grow throughout its life. If a rabbit is
    not constantly grinding their teeth down by eating fiber, we start to see their molar teeth forming sharp
    spikes that damages their cheeks, gums, and tongue. This causes pain that makes them reluctant or unable to eat.
    The incisors at the front of the mouth can, in severe cases, grow around in a curl; meaning rabbits cannot close
    their mouth or eat at all. If left untreated, Overgrown teeth can cause a rabbit to greatly suffer or worse, die.</string>

    <string name="ChewToys"> Chewing on a well made toy helps your rabbit keep its teeth/molars well-trimmed.
    A chew toy can prevent a growing molars on its early stages or prevent it from growing at a dangerous length at all.</string>

    <string name="nailClippers"> This method, although is not advised, can prevent molars to grow to dangerous length.
        It involves a regular dog nail clippers to cut the teeth as you would cut toe nails. But as mentioned before,
        it is not advised not to use this method as there is a high risk of cracking or splitting the tooth because
        of the force needed to use the clippers.
    </string>

    <string name="RotaryTool">
        The third method is to use a handheld rotary tool, like a Dremel or a Dental bur, to slice the excess tooth off.
        This method requires care and skill and sometimes require an anaesthesia or sedation to keep a rabbit still.
        This method causes no trauma to the teeth and nerve. The only concerns are possible trauma to the gums or lips
        if the cutting tool accidentally grazes them or if a tooth is trimmed too short.
